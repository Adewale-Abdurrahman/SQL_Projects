# SQL_Projects

I recently completed a portfolio project using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 
The project involved exploring a coronavirus (COVID-19) dataset from "Our World in Data". 
Using SQL queries, I was able to extract and analyze various data points such as daily confirmed cases, 
deaths, and vaccination rates across different countries and regions. 
It was a challenging but rewarding experience as I gained practical skills in data manipulation, 
analysis, and visualization. Overall, this project helped me sharpen my SQL skills 
and gave me a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact worldwide.
